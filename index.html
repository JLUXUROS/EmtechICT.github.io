       <h2>C-COMFORTABLE</h2>
       <p>Ict is a very comfortable strand for students, actually the ict strand has different parts that are not in other subjects. Ict has three parts,<br>
         this is CSS, ANIMATION and PROGRAMMING. All three of those have something to do with technology.<br> 
         Isn't it so much fun? because we all grew up with technology around us. You will not be boarded in ICT</p>

      <h2 id="C3">Experience</h2>
        <p>as an ict graduate, in my opinion it's fun to be ict students  because what you used to know about<br>
         technology is old and here I found out that things are too high-tech today. I'm very happy because <br>
         I'm pulling this strand of ours. We have taken a lot of related courses in ict but there are still not enough,<br>
         the technology is too broad and not enough so if you choose the ict strand, don't ever give up on this strand.</p>
